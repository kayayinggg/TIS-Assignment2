The visit to UTM Digital is a great opportunity for us to see the daily jobs of the staff and skills they use in their daily work. Through this visit, it offers practical knowledge on how to implement information technology and applications in large organizations, helping us relate theoretical knowledge we learn in Technology and Information System to real-world problems so that we can better prepare ourselves for similar situations in the future. Additionally, We also  gain valuable insights into inner workings of the industry and help us to make decisions regarding career paths or further education.

Moreover, we get exposed to a company's operations and learn about the technical tools and skills required to maintain a complex digital system through collaboration across multiple departments by interacting with staff and touring various locations. This direct interaction make the learning experience more interesting and enjoyable. 

In a nutshell, visiting UTM Digital is an enriching experience for us as a student since our learning process goes beyond just the slides and notes, and it would broaden our horizons about the possibilities and opportunities that science and technology hold.
